  Abstract                 = {Corpora of Early Modern English have been collected and released for research
for a number of years. With large scale digitisation activities gathering pace in
the last decade, much more historical textual data is now available for research
on numerous topics including historical linguistics and conceptual history. We
summarise previous research which has shown that it is necessary to map historical
spelling variants to modern equivalents in order to successfully apply
natural language processing and corpus linguistics methods. Manual and semiautomatic
methods have been devised to support this normalisation and standardisation
process. We argue that it is important to develop a linguistically
meaningful rationale to achieve good results from this process. In order to do
so, we propose a number of guidelines for normalising corpora and show how
these guidelines have been applied in the Corpus of English Dialogues},

  Abstract                 = {The notion of morphological productivity has received considerable clarification from the study of the various kinds of restrictions which have been found to condition word formation rules. In a qualitative sense, the productivity of a word formation rule can be said to be inversely proportional to the number of conditioning factors in force (Booij 1977). Nevertheless, the quantitative outcome of the interaction of the - often highly heterogeneous - conditioning factors has remained rather obscure. The aim of the present paper is to clarify some of the issues involved in the quantification of morphological productivity. In Section 2 three complementary measures of morphological productivity are developed, which make use of the statistical information contained in the empirical frequency distributions of morphological categories in text corpora. Section 3 relates our findings to the theory of the mental lexicon, and Section 4 reviews three models in which the relevance of token frequencies is recognized, the models developed by Anshen and Aronoff (1988), Bybee (1985, 1988) and Rumelhart and McClelland (1986).},

  Abstract                 = {The vocabulary of English and most other languages contains many words that have internal structure (see also article 25). Words such as STRANGENESS, WEAKNESS, and SOFTNESS contain the formative NESS, which is usually found to the right of adjectives. Words ending in NESS are almost always abstract nouns. We refer to the sets of words sharing aspects of form structure and aspects of meaning as morphological categories.
Some morphological categories have a fixed or declining membership, while others have a growing membership. Categories with fixed or declining membership are said to be unproductive, categories with growing membership are described as productive.
Morphological categories differ tremendously in size. Some contain only a few words (e. g., the category of words in TH such as WARMTH and STRENGTH), others may have tens of thousands of members (e. g., nominal compounding). A large morphological category and its associated morphological rule, therefore, are also described as more productive than a small category and its rule. The importance of productivity for studies of the lexicon and lexical processing is witnessed by the fact that no finite lexicon will suffice to process unseen text: Computational tools cannot do without taking productive word formation into account.
A first key question in productivity research is what conditions need to be met for a rule to be productive in these ways. A second key question is whether a rule is ever totally unproductive, i. e., whether productivity is in essence a graded phenomenon. A related issue is how the degree of productivity of a morphological category might be measured. A third set of questions addresses how productivity changes through time, and how affixes are used across registers by different social groups. A final issue is the relation between productivity and processing constraints in the mental lexicon.
How these questions are answered, and the relevance of corpora for guiding research, however, depends crucially on what is viewed as the goal of morphological theory.},

them to understand the quantitative structure of their data. This textbook provides
a straightforward introduction to the statistical analysis of language data.
Designed for linguists with a non-mathematical background, it clearly introduces
the basic principles and methods of statistical analysis, using R, the leading computational
statistics programming environment. The reader is guided step-by-step
through a range of real data sets, allowing them to analyze phonetic data, construct
phylogenetic trees, quantify register variation in corpus linguistics, and analyze
experimental data using state-of-the-art models. The visualization of data plays
a key role, both in the early stages of data exploration and later on when the
reader is encouraged to criticize initial models fitted to the data. Containing over
40 exercises with model answers, this book will be welcomed by all linguists
wishing to learn more about working with and presenting quantitative data.
The program R is available at http://cran.at.r-project.org/. The data sets and ancillary
functions discussed in this book have been brought together in the language
R package, which is available at the same URL.},

Word frequency distributions are characterized by very large numbers of rare words. This property leads to strange statistical phenomena such as mean frequencies that systematically keep changing as the number of observations is increased, relative frequencies that even in large samples are not fully reliable estimators of population probabilities, and model parameters that emerge as functions of the text size.
Special statistical techniques for the analysis of distributions with large numbers of rare events can be found in various technical journals. The aim of this book is to make these techniques more accessible for non-specialists. Chapter 1 introduces some basic concepts and notation. Chapter 2 describes non-parametric methods for the analysis of word frequency distributions. The next chapter describes in detail three parametric models, the lognormal model, the Yule-Simon Zipfian model, and the generalized inverse Gauss-Poisson model. Chapter 4 introduces the concept of mixture distributions. Chapter 5 explores the effect of non-randomness in word use on the accuracy of the nonparametric and parametric models, all of which are based on the assumption that words occur independently and randomly in texts. Chapter 6 presents examples of applications.},

This paper examines the source of this overestimation bias. It is shown that this bias does not arise due to sentence-bound syntactic constraints, but that it is a direct consequence of topic cohesion in discourse. The nonrandom, clustered appearance of lexically specialized words, often the key words of the text, explains the main trends in the overestimation bias both quantitatively and qualitatively. The effects of nonrandomness are so strong that they introduce an overestimation bias in distributions of units derived from words, such as syllables and digrams. Nonrandom word usage also affects the accuracy of the Good-Turing frequency estimates which,for the lowest frequencies, reveal a strong underestimation bias. A heuristic adjusted frequency estimate is proposed that, at least for novel-sized texts, is considerably more accurate.},

This conclusion is supported by the results of a production experiment in which subjects freely created hundreds of productive, but only a handful of unproductive, neologisms. A tentative solution is proposed as to why the opposite pattern has been observed in the speech of jargon aphasics.},

But it is a notion which still remains somewhat problematic in the literature on generative morphology some 15 years after Aronoff raised the issue in his (1976) monograph. In this paper we will review some of the definitions and measures of productivity discussed in the generative and pregenerative literature. We will adopt the definition of productivity suggested by Schultink (1961) and propose a number of statistical measures of productivity whose results, when applied to a fixed corpus, accord nicely with our intuitive estimates of productivity, and which shed light on the quantitative weight of linguistic restrictions on word-formation rules. Part of our purpose here is also a very simple one: to make available a substantial set of empirical data concerning the productivity of some of the major derivational affixes of English.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examines the productivity of five English derivational affixes in a British newspaper, the Times (London), in the period from September 1989 to December 1992. This diachronic corpus of roughly 80 million word tokens contains large numbers of neologisms. Thus, this corpus offers a good opportunity to test both qualitative and quantitative theories of morphological productivity. Our investigations support the usefulness of the quantitative formalization of the notion DEGREE OF PRODUCTIVITY developed in Baayen 1992, 1993a. At the same time, they illustrate that productivity is a function of both text type and real time. An investigation of the morphological structure of the neologisms provides strong support for Aronoff’s (1976) claim that the productivity of an affix may vary significantly with the morphological structure of the base word to which it attaches.},

  Abstract                 = {The present paper addresses a number of issues related to achieving 'representativeness' in linguistic corpus design, including: discussion of what it means to 'represent' a language, definition of the target population, stratified versus proportional sampling of a language, sampling within texts, and issues relating to the required sample size (number of texts) of a corpus. The paper distinguishes among various ways that linguistic features can be distributed within and across texts; it analyses the distributions of several particular features, and it discusses the implications of these distributions for corpus design.
The paper argues that theoretical research should be prior in corpus design, to identify the situational parameters that distinguish among texts in a speech community, and to identify the types of linguistic features that will be analysed in the corpus. These theoretical considerations should be complemented by empirical investigations of linguistic variation in a pilot corpus of texts, as a basis for specific sampling decisions. The actual construction of a corpus would then proceed in cycles: the original design based on theoretical and pilot-study analyses, followed by collection of texts, followed by further empirical investigations of linguistic variation and revision of the design.},

The primary focus of the book is on the analysis of registers. Part 1 introduces an analytical framework for studying registers, genre conventions, and styles. Part 2 provides detailed descriptions of particular text varieties in English, including spoken interpersonal varieties (conversation, university office hours, service encounters), written varieties (newspapers, academic prose, fiction), and emerging electronic varieties (e-mail, internet forums, text messages). Finally, Part 3 introduces advanced analytical approaches using corpora, and discusses theoretical concerns, such as the place of register studies in linguistics, and practical applications of register analysis.

  Abstract                 = {As documented in the articles of this handbook, the central goal of corpus-based analysis is to describe and interpret generalizable patterns of language use. The subdisciplines of discourse analysis and functional linguistics are similar to corpus linguistics in having a primary interest in research questions relating to language use, but these disciplines form a cline in the extent to which they rely on quantitative methods and the value attached to the generalizability of findings. Discourse analytic studies often focus on detailed discussion of a few texts (see, e. g., the survey of studies contained in Schiffrin/Tannen/Hamilton 2001). Functional linguistic studies often focus on linguistic generalizations, with relatively little attention paid to the representativeness of the texts analyzed. In contrast, corpus linguistic investigations of language use are usually designed as quantitative studies with the goal of generalizable findings representing some domain of use.
The design of a corpus is a fundamentally important consideration for achieving this goal: the corpus must be representative of the target domain of use in order for subsequent analyses to be generalized to that domain (see also article 9). Quantitative analyses are also important for generalizable results, because they provide a measure of the extent to which a pattern holds in different domains of use. Computational techniques figure prominently in corpus analyses simply because they enable studies of a scope not feasible otherwise. Computers make it possible to identify and analyze complex patterns of language use, tracking the use of multiple linguistic features across large text collections. Further, computers provide consistent, reliable analyses; they do not change their minds or become tired during an analysis.
The present article provides a survey of the major research designs used in quantitative corpus-based analysis. The article begins with a brief overview of issues of corpus design, recognizing the central place of corpus representativeness for this research approach. We then organize the remainder of the article around the three major kinds of research questions investigated with corpus-based analysis: studies with the word as the primary unit of analysis; studies with a linguistic feature as the primary unit of analysis; and studies with texts as the primary unit of analysis. Finally, we briefly discuss the role of inferential statistics in corpus-based studies of language use.},

relative to the target language (such as obligatory context, error, etc.). It is
demonstrated here that this practice can be a serious obstacle to the investigation of
crucial questions about the nature of learners’ languages. The difficulties caused by this
practice-called here the “comparative fallacy”-are illustrated iii an investigation of
the framework proposed by Tarone, Frauenfelder, and Selinker (1976) to study the
issue of interlanguage systematicity and variability. Their framework is shown to result
in incorrect or unrevealing analyses of systematicity and to obscure the character of the
interlanguage. These defects are shown to be the results of the comparative fallacy.},

  Abstract                 = {Theoretical linguists have traditionally relied on linguistic intuitions such as grammaticality judgments for their data. But the massive growth of computer-readable texts and recordings, the availability of cheaper, more powerful computers and software, and the development of new probabilistic models for language have now made the spontaneous use of language in natural settings a rich and easily accessible alternative source of data.

Surprisingly, many linguists believe that such ‘usage data’ are irrelevant to the theory of grammar. Four problems are repeatedly brought up in the critiques of usage data— 

1. correlated factors seeming to support reductive theories, 
2. pooled data invalidating grammatical inference, 
3. syntactic choices reducing to lexical biases, and 
4. cross-corpus differences undermining corpus studies.

Presenting a case study of work on the English dative alternation, we show first, that linguistic intuitions of grammaticality are deeply flawed and seriously underestimate the space of grammatical possibility, and second, that the four problems in the critique of usage data are empirical issues that can be resolved by using modern statistical theory and modelling strategies widely used in other fields.

The new models allow linguistic theory to solve more difficult problems than it has in the past, and to build convergent projects with psychology, computer science, and allied fields of cognitive science.},

variation work (Eckert, 2005, 2008). Results from a sociolinguistic perception study
suggest that at least in some cases, variants of the same variable function
independently as loci of indexically linked social meaning. Listener responses were
collected to three matched guises of the English variable (ING): -in, -ing, and a
neutral guise with no audible (ING) tokens. The results counter the study
hypothesis that listener expectation, triggered by speaker regional accent, would
shape (ING)’s impact. Instead, the two variants showed distinct social associations:
the -ing guises were rated as more intelligent/educated, more articulate, and less
likely to be a student than either the -in or neutral guises, which did not differ
significantly. In contrast, -in guises made speakers sound less formal and less
likely to be gay than the -ing and neutral guises, which did not differ. These results
suggest that third-wave work needs to more closely examine the role of the variable
in theorizing the relationship between linguistic and social structures.},

  Abstract                 = {The treatment of social meaning in sociolinguistic variation has come
in three waves of analytic practice. The first wave of variation studies
established broad correlations between linguistic variables and the
macrosociological categories of socioeconomic class, sex, class, ethnicity,
and age. The second wave employed ethnographic methods to explore
the local categories and configurations that inhabit, or constitute,
these broader categories. In both waves, variation was seen as marking
social categories. This article sets out a theoretical foundation for the
third wave, arguing that (a) variation constitutes a robust social semiotic
system, potentially expressing the full range of social concerns in
a given community; (b) the meanings of variables are underspecified,
gainingmore specific meanings in the context of styles, and (c) variation
does not simply reflect, but also constructs, social meaning and hence
is a force in social change.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of collocations is certainly one of the most controversial notions in linguistics, even though it is based on a compelling, widely shared intuition that certain words have a tendency to occur near each other in natural language. Examples of such collocations are cow and milk, day and night, ring and bell, or the infamous kick and bucket. Other words, like know and glass or door and year, do not seem to be particularly attracted to each other. J. R. Firth (1957) introduced the term “collocations” for characteristic and frequently recurrent word combinations, arguing that the meaning and usage of a word (the node) can to some extent be characterised by its most typical collocates: “You shall know a word by the company it keeps” (Firth 1957, 179). Firth was clearly aware of the limitations of this approach. He understood collocations as a convenient first approximation to meaning at a purely lexical level that can easily be operationalised (cf. Firth 1957, 181). Collocations in this Firthian sense can also be interpreted as empirical statements about the predictability of word combinations: they quantify the “mutual expectancy” (Firth 1957, 181) between words and the statistical influence a word exerts on its neighbourhood. Firth’s definition of the term remained vague, though, and it was only formalised and implemented after his death, by a group of British linguists often referred to as the Neo-Firthian school. Collocations have found widespread application in computational lexicography (Sinclair 1966, 1991), resulting in corpus-based dictionaries such as COBUILD (Sinclair 1995; see also article 8).
In parallel to the development of the Neo-Firthian school, the term “collocations” came to be used in the field of phraseology for semi-compositional and lexically determined word combinations such as stiff drink (with a special meaning of stiff restricted to a particular set of nouns), heavy smoker (where heavy is the only acceptable intensifier for smoker), give a talk (rather than make or hold) and a school of fish (rather than group, swarm or flock). This view has been advanced forcefully by Hausmann (1989) and has found increasingly widespread acceptance in recent years (e. g. Grossmann/Tutin 2003). It is notoriously difficult to give a rigorous definition of collocations in the phraseological sense and differentiate them from restricted word senses (most dictionaries have separate subentries for the special meanings of stiff, heavy and school in the examples above). There is considerable overlap between the phraseological notion of collocations and the more general empirical notion put forward by Firth (cf. the examples given above), but they are also different in many respects (e. g., good and time are strongly collocated in the empirical sense, but a good time can hardly be understood as a noncompositional or lexically restricted expression). This poor alignment between two interpretations of the same term has resulted in frequent misunderstandings and has led to enormous confusion on both sides. The situation is further complicated by a third meaning of “collocations” in the field of computational linguistics, where it is often used as a generic term for any lexicalised word combination that has idiosyncratic semantic or syntactic properties and may therefore require special treatment in a machine-readable dictionary or natural language processing system. This usage seems to originate with Choueka (1988) and can be found in standard textbooks, where collocations are often defined in terms of non-compositionality, non-modifiability and non-substitutability (Manning/Schütze 1999, 184). It has recently been superseded by the less ambiguous term multiword expression (cf. Sag et al. 2002).
An excellent overview of the competing definitions of collocations and their historical development is given by Bartsch (2004). Interestingly, she takes a middle road with her working definition of collocations as “lexically and/or pragmatically constrained recurrent co-occurrences of at least two lexical items which are in a direct syntactic relation with each other” (Bartsch 2004, 76). For a compact summary, refer to Williams (2003).},

The ‘library metaphor’ illustrates how randomness results from the selection of a corpus as the basis for a linguistic study. At the same time it reveals two reasons why corpus data do not fully meet the assumptions of the random sample model. Finally, practicable methods for identifying and quantifying non-randomness are introduced and demonstrated on the example of passive verb forms.},

  Abstract                 = {In natural language, words are not combined randomly into phrases and sentences, constrained only by the rules of syntax. They have a tendency to appear in certain recurrent combinations, prompting Firth (1957) to coin his famous slogan: You shall know a word by the company it keeps!. Indeed, such cooccurrences – whether they are immediately adjacent words, stand in a particular syntactic relation or just tend to be used in the same sentence – are a goldmine of information for linguistics and natural language processing. They include compound nouns (black box), fixed idioms (kick the bucket), lexically determined combinations (heavy smoker) and formulaic expressions (have a nice day). They can often tell us something about the meaning of a word (think of combinations like dark night and bright day), an idea that has inspired latent semantic analysis and similar vector space models of word meaning.
With modern computers it is easy to extract evidence for recurrent word pairs from huge text corpora, often aided by linguistic pre-processing and annotation (so that specific combinations, e.g. noun+verb can be targeted). However, the raw data – in the form of frequency counts for word pairs – are often not very meaningful as a measure for the amount of “glue” between two words. Provided that both words are sufficiently frequent, their cooccurrences might be pure coincidence. Therefore, a statistical interpretation of the frequency data is necessary, which determines the degree of statistical association between the words and attempts to factor out the effects of chance. The most widely used method is the application of so-called association measures, which assign a score to each word pair based on the observed frequency data. The higher this score is, the stronger and more certain the association between the two words.
The earliest reports of the application of association measures to language data go back to Stevens et al. (1965). Even at that time, an enormous range of different measures was available, borrowed from mathematical statistics and related fields. With so many options, but little guidance as to which measure to choose, Giuliano (1965b, 259) reflected: “One suspects that each has its own possible merits and disadvantages, but the line between the profound and the trivial often appears blurred. One thing which is badly needed is a better understanding of the boundary conditions under which the various techniques are applicable and the expected gains to be achieved through using one or the other of them. . . . it is my feeling that the time is now ripe to conduct carefully controlled experiments of an evaluative nature, . . . ”
It is amazing to see how little progress has been made in the understanding of word cooccurrences and association measures in the forty years that have passed since these words were written. The reference work that Giuliano felt was so urgently needed – a compendium that lists, explains and compares the multitude of available association measures – has never seen the light of day. My thesis aims to fill this gap, providing both a comprehensive reference and a methodology for the kind of research Giuliano envisaged.},

  Abstract                 = {Corpus Workbench (CWB) is a widely-used architecture for corpus analysis, originally designed at the IMS, University of Stuttgart (Christ 1994). It consists of a set of tools for indexing, managing and querying very large corpora with multiple layers of word-level annotation. CWB’s central component is the Corpus Query Processor (CQP), an extremely powerful and efficient concordance system implementing a flexible two-level search language that allows complex query patterns to be specified both at the level of an individual word or annotation, and at the level of a fully- or partially-specified pattern of tokens. CWB and CQP are commonly used as the back-end for web-based corpus interfaces, for example, in the popular BNCweb interface to the British National Corpus (Hoffmann et al. 2008). CWB has influenced other tools, such as the Manatee software used in SketchEngine, which implements the same query language (Kilgarriff et al. 2004). This paper details recent work to update CWB for the new century. Perhaps the most significant development is that CWB version 3 is now an open source project, licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. This change has substantially enlarged the community of developers and users and has enabled us to leverage existing open-source libraries in extending CWB’s capabilities. As a result, several key improvements were made to the CWB core: (i) support for multiple character sets, most especially Unicode (in the form of UTF-8), allowing all the world’s writing systems to be utilised within a CWB-indexed corpus; (ii) support for powerful Perl-style regular expressions in CQP queries, based on the open-source PCRE library; (iii) support for a wider range of OS platforms including Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows; and (iv) support for larger corpus sizes of up to 2 billion words on 64-bit platforms. Outside the CWB core, a key concern is the user-friendliness of the interface. CQP itself can be daunting for beginners. However, it is common for access to CQP queries to be provided via a web-interface, supported in CWB version 3 by several Perl modules that give easy access to different facets of CWB/CQP functionality. The CQPweb front-end (Hardie forthcoming) has now been adopted as an integral component of CWB. CQPweb provides analysis options beyond concordancing (such as collocations, frequency lists, and keywords) by using a MySQL database alongside CQP. Available in both the Perl interface and CQPweb is the Common Elementary Query Language (CEQL), a simple-syntax set of search patterns and wildcards which puts much of the power of CQP in a form accessible to beginning students and non-corpus-linguists. The paper concludes with a roadmap for future development of the CWB (version 4 and above), with a focus on even larger corpora, full support for XML and dependency annotation, new types of query languages, and improved efficiency of complex CQP queries. All interested users are invited to help us shape the future of CWB by discussing requirements and contributing to the implementation of these features.},

In a previous study, I reviewed many of these measures and suggested an alternative measure, DP (for ‘deviation of proportions’), which I argued to be conceptually simpler and more versatile than many competing measures. However, despite the relevance of dispersion for virtually all corpus-linguistic work, it is still a very much under-researched topic: to the best of my knowledge, there is not a single study investigating how different measures compare to each other when applied to large datasets, nor is there any work that attempts to determine how different measures match up with the kind of psycholinguistic data that dispersions and adjusted frequencies are supposed to represent. This article takes exploratory steps in both of these directions.},

However, such frequencies in isolation may sometimes be misleading since they do not take into consideration the degree of dispersion of the relevant linguistic variable. Many dispersion measures and adjusted frequency measures have been suggested but are neither widely known nor applied. Another unfortunate aspect of such measures is that many also come with a variety of problems. I pursue three objectives with this article. First, I want to raise awareness of this issue and make the available measures more widely known, so I present an overview of many measures of dispersion and adjusted frequencies. Second, I propose a conceptually simple alternative measure, DP, explain and exemplify it, and compare it to previously discussed measures. Third and most importantly, I urge corpus linguists to explore the notion of dispersion in more detail and outline a few proposals which steps to take next.},

On the basis of data from the ICE-GB corpus, I analyze two different pairs of syntactic patterns, the so-called dative alternation and particle placement of transitive phrasal verbs. Although it has sometimes been argued that only experimental data can contribute to studies of priming, the analysis shows that (a) the corpus-based results for datives are very similar to the experimental ones; (b) priming is also obtained for the verb-particle construction, a construction hitherto not explored in the priming literature and (c), most importantly, in line with much previous psycholinguistic and corpus-linguistic work, priming effects turn out to be strongly verb-specific such that some verbs are much more resistant or responsive to priming than others. I conclude with a discussion of how corpus data relate to experimental data and how the corpus-based findings can contribute to psycholinguistic model building.},

suffix from an interdental fricative (giveth) to an alveolar fricative (gives). Based on the
PCEEC corpus, we analyze more than 20,000 examples from the time between 1417 and
1681 to determine (i) the temporal stages in which this development took place and (ii)
the factors that are correlated with this change.
As for (i), we use a bottom-up clustering method which shows that the shift from -(e)th
to -(e)s is best characterized as consisting of five stages. As for (ii), we examine multiple
language-internal and language-external factors, including several variables proposed in
earlier accounts. We fit a generalized linear mixed-effects model, which allows us to
predict nearly 95 per cent of all inflectional choices correctly, thus revealing which factors
shaped the development over time in a data-driven and highly precise way.},

it is based on identifying and merging the most cohesive groups of data

The method, referred to as 'distinctive-collexeme analysis', identifies lexemes that exhibit a strong preference for one member of the pair as opposed to the other, and thus makes it possible to identify subtle distributional differences between the members of such a pair. The method can be applied in the context of what is sometimes referred to as ‘grammatical alternation’ (e.g. the dative alternation), but it can also be applied to other choices provided by the grammar (such as the two future tense constructions in English). The method has two main applications. First, it can reveal subtle differences between seemingly synonymous constructions, many of which are difficult to identify on the basis of more traditional approaches. Second, it can be used to investigate the very notion of ‘alternation’; we show that many alternations are much more restricted than has hitherto been assumed, and thus confirm the claims of recent, non-derivational views of grammar.},

  Abstract                 = {In Construction Grammar, the ultimate grammatical unit is the construction, a conventionalized form-meaning pairing. We present interrelated evidence from three different methods, all of which speak in favor of attributing an ontological status to constructions for non-native speakers of English. Firstly, in a sentence-fragment completion study with German learners of English, we obtained a significant priming effect between constructions. Secondly, these priming effects correlate strongly with the verb-construction preferences in native speaker corpora: verbs which are strongly associated with one construction resist priming to another semantically compatible construction; more importantly, the priming effects do not correlate with verb-construction preferences from German translation equivalents, ruling out a translational explanation. Thirdly, in order to rule out an alternative account in terms of syntactic rather than constructional priming, we present semantic evidence obtained by a sorting study, showing that subjects exhibited a strong tendency towards a construction-based sorting, which even reflects recent explanations of how constructions are related.},

  Abstract                 = {This dissertation describes the methods and the results of a corpus-based regional dialect
survey of grammatical variation in written Standard American English. The primary
goals of this survey are to identify grammatical features that are regionally patterned in
written Standard American English and to use this information to map regional American
dialects. This is the first survey of regional grammatical variation in American English
and the first survey of regional linguistic variation in written Standard American English.
This survey is based on a unique approach to data collection and data analysis,
which makes use of techniques commonly employed in corpus linguistic and quantitative
geography. The values of 45 continuous grammatical variables were measured
computationally across a 25 million word corpus of letters to the editor representing the
language of 200 cities from across the United States. The regional distribution of each
variable was then analyzed using global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics in
order to identify variables whose values are regionally patterned in the corpus. Finally,
the grammatical variables were analyzed as a group using spatial autocorrelation
statistics, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis in order to
identify general patterns of regional linguistic variation and in order to map American
dialect regions. Using this methodology, numerous regionally patterned grammatical features
were identified and a taxonomy of American regional dialects was produced that
identified 12 primary American dialect regions: the Pacific Northwest, the Pacific
Southwest, the Mountain West, West Texas, the Eastern Midwest, the Western Midwest,
the South Central, the Deep South, the Upper South, the South Atlantic, the Middle
Atlantic and New England. These dialect regions are similar to the dialect regions
identified by previous American dialect surveys but also differ in numerous important
ways. In order to account for these findings, it is demonstrated that the dialect regions
identified by this survey correspond closely to modern American cultural areas.
Furthermore, it is argued that the differences between the results of this survey and the
results of previous American dialect surveys, which are based on historical forms of
English, probably reflect regional dialect change resulting from changing American
cultural areas.},

increasingly wide-spread in historical corpus linguistics. This development is
partly due to the fact that more and more resources of this kind are being
developed. Since the assessment of frequency changes over multiple periods of
time is a relatively recent practice, there are few agreed-upon standards of how
such trends should be statistically interpreted. This article addresses the need for
a basic analytical toolbox that is specifically tailored to the interpretation of
frequency changes in multistage diachronic corpora. We present a number of
suggestions for the analysis of data that analysts commonly face in historical
studies, but also in the study of language acquisition.},

primary and structural data. The fact that primary data are of major concern in both fields

of corpora, and of text types. Our method is to classify the top one hundred

a range of contrasts between all the pairs of corpora we apply it to. We also
present improved maths for keywords, and briefly discuss quantitative comparisons

We also propose a generic solution for specialized corpus visualizations in a Web interface using annotation-triggered style sheets, which leverage the power of modern browsers and CSS for multiple and highly customizable views of primary data. We offer an implementation and evaluation of our architecture in ANNIS3, an open-source browser-based architecture for corpus search and visualization. We present three case studies to test the coverage of the system, encompassing core linguistic and digital humanities use-cases including richly annotated newspaper treebanks, multilingual diplomatic and normalized manuscript materials edited in TEI, and analysis of multimodal recordings of spoken language.},

require attention to principles of methodology which consider sources of
error and ways to eliminate them. The methodological assumptions and
practices of various branches of linguistics are considered from the standpoint
of the types of data gathered: texts, elicitations, intuitions and observations.
Observations of the vernacular provide the most systematic basis for
linguistic theory, but have been the most difficult kinds of data for linguists
to obtain; techniques for solving the problems encountered are outlined.
Intersubjective agreement is best reached by convergence of several kinds
of data with complementary sources of error.},

  Abstract                 = {Dialectometric techniques for analyzing variation in the aggregate are maturing
rapidly, but there is still little agreement on how to extract linguistic structure
from aggregate comparison. The present study explores one means of comparing
aggregate analyses in order to determine linguistically concise characterizations of
restrictions, essentially the use of factor analysis (FA). Using the Southern states
data which Guy Lowman collected as part of LAMSAS, we apply FA to the vowels
involved in aggregate analyses in order to determine which alternations in
pronunciation tend most to co-occur.},

  Abstract                 = {Annotated corpora of learner language can be useful for SLA researchers
 and FL teachers. Tagging phenomena with part of speech (POS) information
 and grammatical relations between words can make it feasible to search
 in a learner corpus for abstract grammatical properties not easily
 captured through a lexical search (e.g., headless relative clauses).
 One type of corpus annotation for learner language has focused on
 so-called errors (e.g., Granger, 2003), using specific error tags
 for phenomena that 'deviate' from the L2. Some of these schemes make
 use of target hypotheses, attempting to capture the learner's intention.
 These approaches risk falling into the comparative fallacy (Bley-Vroman,
 1983), since they try to map specific phenomena in interlanguage
 to target categories in the L2. The task is even more challenging
 with ambiguous utterances. In the same vein, it is undesirable to
 bias any annotation in terms of the L1 (cf. Lakshmanan & Selinker,
 2001). A recent approach is to annotate interlanguage as it appears,
 without focusing on errors (e.g., Diaz-Negrillo et al, 2010; Dickinson
 and Ragheb, 2009). In providing linguistic annotation such as POS
 tags or syntactic relations, one has to ensure that the annotation
 supports different topics of SLA research, while avoiding the comparative
 fallacy or inferring learner intention. This paper discusses the
 ramifications of annotating syntactic properties in learner language
 and pinpoints where annotation designers must be aware of the comparative
 fallacy. Using different layers of annotation to capture variability
 in learner language, the authors argue that one should annotate observable
 linguistic properties that are clearly defined. They show how even
 if one defines the properties in terms of the L2, a systematic description
 of learner data can support L2 syntactic studies, provide insight
 into interlanguage, and avoid inferring intention, putting the final
 interpretation of the data in the hands of SLA researchers.},

By detailed descriptions of the implementation and systematic evaluations of the performance of the software on different types of systems, I show that the COW14 architecture is capable of handling the creation of corpora of up to at least 100 billion tokens. I also introduce our running demo system which currently serves corpora of up to roughly 20 billion tokens in Dutch, Englisch, French, German, Spanish, and Swedish.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last decade, methods of web corpus construction and the evaluation of web corpora have been actively researched. Prominently, the WaCky initiative has provided both theoretical results and a set of web corpora for selected European languages. We present a software toolkit for web corpus construction and a set of siginificantly larger corpora (up to over 9 billion tokens) built using this software. First, we discuss how the data should be collected to ensure that it is not biased towards certain hosts. Then, we describe our software toolkit which performs basic cleanups as well as boilerplate removal, simple connected text detection as well as shingling to remove duplicates from the corpora. We finally report evaluation results of the corpora built so far, for example w. r. t. the amount of duplication contained and the text type/genre distribution. Where applicable, we compare our corpora to the WaCky corpora, since it is inappropriate, in our view, to compare web corpora to traditional or balanced corpora. While we use some methods applied by the WaCky initiative, we can show that we have introduced incremental improvements.},

second, determinants of aggregate morphosyntactic variability in traditional British
English dialects; and third, aggregate morphosyntactic distances between World
Englishes. We discuss advantages, limitations, and problems inherent in aggregate
data analysis, and sketch the range of possible applications.},

Dieses Tagset basiert auf der Annotation des FOLK-Korpus des IDS Mannheim (Schmidt 2014) und es wurde gegen{\"u}ber dem STTS erweitert in Hinblick auf typisch gesprochensprachliche Ph{\"a}nomene bzw. Eigenheiten der Transkription derselben. Es entstand im Rahmen des Dissertationsprojekts „POS f{\"u}r(s) FOLK – Entwicklung eines automatisierten Part-of-Speech-Tagging von spontansprachlichen Daten“ (Westpfahl 2017 (i.V.)).},
